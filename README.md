**Tasks covered:**

- **Create a RN Rummy app:**
  - On launch, it should open the 2-player game table in landscape mode and show:
    - Hand cards opening up.
    - Closed and open deck.
    - Sort button.
  
- **Gameplay:**
  1. Start the timer of your turn for 60 sec.
  2. A person can pick a card and then can discard.
  3. Once done or timer ends, the turn should move to the opponent. Once the opponent's timer ends, it should be your turn again. Repeat the above steps.

- **User Interaction:**
  - Provide a "Leave" button to exit the game at any point in time.

- **Structure:**

- **Dependencies Used:**
  - react-native-circular-progress-indicator
  - react-native-exit-app
  - react-native-reanimated
  - react-native-svg
  - react-native-svg-charts

- **Logic:**
  - setInterval hook is used to maintain the timer logic.
  - Once your user selects the card your user can also deselect the card. This is done with useState hook.
  - Once you select any card sort button will be converted to Discard.
  - Once the selection of card is done and timer is running you can deselect the same or you can click on Discard Button.
  - If your timer is finished and you havenâ€™t unselected the card the timer will move to opponent user and your selection will be discarded.
  - When opponent timer is running you cannot select the card.
